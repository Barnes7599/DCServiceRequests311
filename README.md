### DC Service Calls (311) Data Analysis and Visualizations

This project breaks down DC Service Calls (311) in 2022. This is an ongoing project that I will utilize to learn more about R and Data Visualizations. Please follow along or check back from time to time to see the progress.

The data was extracted from the Open Data DC website. There is a treasure trove of data that you can shift through to use for your own project or download the data [here](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/311-city-service-requests-in-2022/explore?location=39.971127%2C-78.566945%2C8.99&showTable=true) if you want to follow along.

311 City Service Requests are made directly on the official DC 311 website where residents can submit a request, check the status explore, maps, find resources for residents, businesses and visitors. The data used in this project is provided by the Office of Unified Communications, which collects detailed information on 311 Service calls. The data dictionary can be found [here](https://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/DCGIS::311-city-service-requests-in-2022/about)

This is a great data set that you can use to better your data analysis and visualization skills as it contains 25 attributes that make up the data set. You can explore service order dates tied to request resolution to mapping out where the Service Calls are located using Latitude and Longitude coordinates the analysis that can be done on this data set is endless.
